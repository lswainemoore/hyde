This post is a quick(ish) follow-up to one I tweeted out last Thursday. Check that out [here](http://lswainemoore.com/2016/08/18/missing-romney-votes/) if you haven't already for the full background.

Ryan Godfrey [shared](https://twitter.com/rgodfrey/status/766376451402633216) my post (thanks, Ryan!), and raised some questions [here](https://twitter.com/rgodfrey/status/766380753387130880) and [here](https://twitter.com/rgodfrey/status/766381312605315073):

> @lswainemoore I'd like to look at history of a larger group of divisions that had 95%+ Obama machine votes (just vs. Romney) in '12 general.

> @lswainemoore Interested to see how they voted in '08 and '04 generals and primaries and '16 primaries.

I also thought it would be interesting to look into this, so I did so, albeit a bit belatedly. You can check out my iPython notebook [here]().

The first thing I did was find those districts that voted overwhelmingly for Obama in the 2012 general election.

While there were only 59 divisons that cast no votes for Romney by machine in the general, there were 766 divisons (~45% of all 1687) where the two-way vote between Obama and Romney was 95%+ for Obama (i.e. # of Obama votes / # of Obama or Romney votes >= 0.95).
