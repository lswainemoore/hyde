Welcome! This page is under development. I'll have more about myself on here soon.

My name is Lincoln Swaine-Moore, and I'm an undergraduate at Yale University studying Computer Science. I'll be graduating in 2017.

I'm interested in:

* Machine learning
* Data science
* Cryptography
* Blockchain technology
* ...and how the above fit into government and politics!
